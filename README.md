# Hangman
Just a classic Hangman game made by Unity Engine for Android phones.

This game is quite old, and it has a lot of clones in play store, but so far no lithuanian version is good.<br>
So I though I could make this classical game a lot better.<br>
Features:<br>
* No Internet connection needed.<br>
* No extra permissions needed.No data spying.<br>
* About 300 000 lithuanian words.<br>
* 4 Different difficulty levels. <br>
* Basic statistics.<br>
