# Hangman
Just a classic Hangman game made by Unity Engine for Android phones.

This game is quite old, and it has a lot of clones in play store, but so far no lithuanian version is good.<br>
So I though I could make this classical game a lot better.<br><br>
Features:<br>
* No Internet connection is needed ( except for Facebook actions ).<br>
* No extra permissions are needed.<br>
* About 300 000 lithuanian words.<br>
* 2 Different game modes.<br>
* 4 Different difficulty levels. <br>
* Facebook integration.<br>
* Facebook leaderboards.<br>
* Game is free.<br>
